# UIDAI-Hackathon-2026-Analysis
A data-driven analysis and predictive model for Aadhaar lifecycle data.
## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on a data-driven approach to optimize Aadhaar services across India. By analyzing 1 million+ rows of lifecycle data (Jan-Dec 2025), I have developed a predictive model to forecast 2026 demand and identify infrastructure gaps.

## 🛠 Key Technical Methodology
**Data Integration:** Successfully merged 12 specialized UIDAI datasets into a single unified master engine using Pandas.

**Advanced Cleaning:** Standardized 55+ state name variations into 36 unique legal entities and implemented integrity checks to ensure 100% data validity.

**Predictive Modeling:** Built a forecasting engine using Linear Regression to predict a steady shift from new enrolments to biometric updates in 2026.
